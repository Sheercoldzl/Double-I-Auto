Team:

* Person 1 - Isaac - Service Microservice
* Person 2 - Ian LI - Sales

## Design
Our design encompassed a user friendly interface that was easy to read and easy to utilize, endeavoring to fully take advantage of the strengths of the microservice model.

The starter application comes with a fully-functioning scaffold of microservices, a front-end application, and a database. The bold text services in the following list are the ones that you and your teammate will implement:
Inventory API: provides Manufacturer, Model, and Automobile RESTful API endpoints but needs a front-end
Database: the PostgreSQL database that will hold the data of all of the microservices

## Service microservice

Explain your models and integration with the inventory
microservice, here.

## Sales microservice

Chose salespoerson, customer, salesrecord and automobile as our Value object.  The intentionb was for a salesrecord filtered through the sales person and we included a salesperson and technician form together as an employee list.
